Master Degree Project: I'm using YoloV3 to count cars in a traffic jam 

Master's Degree Diploma: Vehicle detection and counting
system using deep learning
This paper presents a Python-based solution using YOLOv3 for
detecting and localizing vehicles through a convolutional type deep neural network. The process covers the dataset
preparation, meticulous image labeling, network training,
and practical application. Implemented on a robust platform
with dual GeForce RTX 2080 GPUs, the trained network excels
in detecting, tracking, and counting vehicles. Leveraging
the open-source SORT algorithm for tracking, diverse video
sequences demonstrated the model's accuracy even with
previously unseen data, affirming the solution's
effectiveness.
